Ziqi's Portfolio for Telling Stories with Data!

## About Me

Hi everyone! 

My name is Ziqi Zhou, and I am a Master of Entertainment Industry Management (MEIM) student at CMU. My pronouns are she/her/hers. I got my Bachelor of Science in Statistcs and Bachelor of Arts in Music History and Industry at UCLA. Because of my distinct background, I decided to find a place where I can search for the intersection between entertainment and technology. Therefore, I am interested in doing research/data oriented jobs such as data analyst for entertainment companies in the future. This website includes some projects and assignments I have been doing in Telling Stories with Data class. All sketches are drawn by me in the process of making data visualizations and all graphs are made using Tableau or Flourish.
