Ziqi's Portfolio for Telling Stories with Data!

# About Me

Hi everyone! My name is Ziqi Zhou, and I am a Master of Entertainment Industry Management (MEIM) student at CMU. My pronouns are she/her/hers. I got my Bachelor of Science in Statistcs and Bachelor of Arts in Music History and Industry at UCLA. Because of my two distinct majors, I decided to find a place where I can search for the intersection between entertainment and technology. Therefore, I am interested in doing research/data oriented jobs such as data analyst for entertainment companies in the future. 

## What I hope to Learn

I am super excited for this class because I had a chance to explore Tableau in undergraduate studies, however, I am not an expert in data visualizations. In this class, I hope to learn designing techniques, experience data visualization tolls, and practice the skills that could be useful for me in the future.
