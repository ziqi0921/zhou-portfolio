# User Research Protocol

## Target Audience

The target audience for this project is TikTok users. The younger generations of the general public (they don't have to use TikTok, their friends will talk about TikTok trends in daily conversations) as their age groups use TikTok more frequently. Musicians and music labels are also part of the target audience. 

## Identifying Representative Individuals to interview

Given my target audience, I found three people among my friends and family members that have these characteristics and is willing to participate in my study. Here are the demographics of the three people that I will be interviewing:

- Student, Female, 22, heavy user of TikTok, no data visualization background, some music background
- Adult, Female, 47, use TikTok on a daily basis, no data visualization background, no music background
- Student, Female, 23, don't often use TikTok, data background, some music background

## Script

With each of the three representative individuals, I will show them my storyboard, talk about my data visualizations, and ask them the following questions:

- Did anything stood out to you?
- Looking at the overall storyboard, what works for you?
- Do you feel anything is unclear? Is there any gaps of information?
- Is there anything you would change?
- What do you feel looking at the storyboard at different stages? 

From these questions, I hope to get feedback from my target audiences to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of my data visualizations, the emotional impacts, and if my story is comprehensible. 

## User Research Findings

| Questions  | First Person | Second Person | Third Person |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Did anything stood out to you?  | I do realize that TikTok was getting more popular, but I have no idea that it is beginning to change the music industry. That was a nice presentation.  | I think it is true that TikTok is changing the music industry because a lot more people now is talking about it.  | I like your idea about TikTok and the data you gathered. I think your website is fancy.  |
| Looking at the overall storyboard, what works for you?  | I think the part where you scroll and the graph changes is very engaging (the scrollmation). The pie chart is very effective.  | I like the pie chart, I think it tells the audience that there is a change brought by TikTok within the three years on the music industry.  | I think the flow of your story is engaging, and you are usin data visualizations to speak about your points. |
| Do you feel anything is unclear? Is there any gaps of information?  | I think your story is pretty clear.  | I think it feels a little weird jumping from the trends to the copyright issues, you can modify that a little. | I don't know if the different graphs of the features (the scrollmation) is that important because there is not a clear trend. |
| Is there anything you would change? | I would   | Content Cell  | I would love if you could include a data visualization of why is it important to respond to your call to action as well.  |
| What do you feel looking at the storyboard at different stages?  | At first, I am excited that you are doing a project based on TikTok trends. Then as I look at your data visualizations I realized that TikTok is becoming a big thing in the music industry especially when all the record labels are creating music based on the trend data.  | I think you are doing a good job and I understand all the data you showed me. | I feel engaging throughout and it made me reflect on my experiences with TikTok and if I have noticed these changes. |

Some feedbacks I think are valueable:

- I need to think more about the call to action and how to connect it with my story tighter. 
- 
- The pie chart is more simple and concise, and it will be more effective if I include that in my final presentation. 

## In-Class Critique

During the in-class critique, I asked the classmates if they think my call to action is valid. One of them said that my call to action based only on my data stories would be more towards the label companies and how they can use the trends that I provided for their future song releases. Their idea is that I can include both my original call to action and this new one in my more detailed webpage, and only present one of them in the presentation. 

## Changes to Implement Next Week

Based on the feedbacks I got both from interviewing and the in-class, I will consider these changes in Part 3:
