## Outline

Lil Nas X, born in 1999, dropped out after one year of college to work in restaurants and playgrounds. In 2019, he dominated the Billboard chart with "Old Town Road" and won a Grammy Award, and quickly became a hot new star in the music industry within a few months. There are many similar examples.

More importantly, TikTok traffic is not a bubble, but is directly linked to streaming media playback, mainstream music charts, record company invitations, offline performances, etc. Every part of the music industry is being influenced by TikTok.

Next, I wanted to show that TikTok is profoundly affecting the creators, streamers, record companies, and listeners. Based recent news, many well-known singers have openly complained on TikTok on social media, stating that record companies and Agent companies are now desperate for TikTok, arranging the release of songs by platform hotspots and trends and give them quantitive indicators on creating TikTok contents. According to the TikTok 2021 Report, over 175 songs that trended on TikTok ended up charting on the Billboard Hot 100. TikTok becomes more than just business, but also aesthetics and tastes. From this, I will use data visualizations to showcase how many songs popular on TikTok overlap with the Billboard Hot 100 and Spotify's top list and how the overlap changes in recent few years.

## Data

There are three data sets I am planning to use:

- TikTok Popular Songs 2022 from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sveta151/tiktok-popular-songs-2022?resource=download)
- Billboard Hot 100  from [Data World](https://data.world/kcmillersean/billboard-hot-100-1958-2017)

The TikTok 2022 dataset contains


## Method and Medium

This project will be completed using Shorthand to make the web more engaging and interactive to the audience. All the data visualizations will be done using Tableau and Florish and link to Shorthand to back up the story. There will be two versions of Shorthand created: one with detail on all the stories, data visualizations, and examples and another condensed version for in-class presentation.
