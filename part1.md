# Part I: Final Project


## Outline

Lil Nas X, born in 1999, dropped out after one year of college to work in restaurants and playgrounds. In 2019, he dominated the Billboard chart with "Old Town Road" and won a Grammy Award, and quickly became a hot new star in the music industry within a few months. There are many similar examples. On TikTok, it only takes 15 seconds to give countless people a chance to become famous. More importantly, TikTok traffic is not a bubble, but is directly linked to streaming media playback, mainstream music charts, record company invitations, offline performances, etc. Every part of the music industry is being influenced by TikTok. The story I will focus on in this project is the impact TikTok has had on the music industry, highlight some negative consequences of these changes, and provide a call-to-action to the audiences.

## Method and Medium

This project will be completed using Shorthand to make the web more engaging and interactive to the audience. All the data visualizations will be done using Tableau and Florish and link to Shorthand to back up the story. There will be two versions of Shorthand created: one with detail on all the stories, data visualizations, and examples and another condensed version for in-class presentation.
