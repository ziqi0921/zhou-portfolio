# Part I: Final Project


## Outline

The story I will focus on in this project is the impact TikTok has had on the music industry, highlight some negative consequences of these changes, and provide a call-to-action to the audiences. Lil Nas X, born in 1999, dropped out after one year of college to work in restaurants and playgrounds. In 2019, he dominated the Billboard chart with "Old Town Road" and won a Grammy Award, and quickly became a hot new star in the music industry within a few months. There are many similar examples on TikTok as it only takes 15 seconds to give countless people a chance to become famous. More importantly, TikTok traffic is not a bubble, but is directly linked to streaming media playback, mainstream music charts, record company invitations, offline performances, etc. Every part of the music industry is being influenced by TikTok. 

Next, I wanted to show that TikTok is profoundly affecting the creators, streamers, record companies, and listeners. Based recent news, many well-known singers have openly complained on TikTok on social media, stating that record companies and Agent companies are now desperate for TikTok, arranging the release of songs by platform hotspots and trends and give them quantitive indicators on creating TikTok contents. According to the [TikTok 2021 Report](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/year-on-tiktok-music-report-2021), over 175 songs that trended on TikTok ended up charting on the Billboard Hot 100. TikTok becomes more than just business, but also aesthetics and tastes. From this, I will use data visualizations to showcase how many songs popular on TikTok overlap with the Billboard Hot 100 and Spotify's top list and how the overlap changes in recent few years. 

According to statistics from [Quartz](https://qz.com/1519823/is-spotify-making-songs-shorter), from 2013 to 2018, the average length of the Billboard Hot 100 hits dropped by 20 seconds, and the emergence of TikTok has greatly accelerated this trend. Moreover, there are singers who customize TikTok songs based on platform trends and memes, such as Canadian rapper Tiagz, who draws inspiration from almost all of his songs from existing memes on the platform. After sampling and mixing, he mass-produces songs, and there is always something to hit. In such a fast-paced update, many creators are short-lived on TikTok and to some extent, there is a lack of diversity of the trending songs on TikTok as the homogenization of such songs becomes more serious. I will use data to show the characteristics that is common among popular TikTok songs and how it compare to the characteristics of the Billboard Hot 100 songs overtime. For example, comparing the "dancability", duration, BPM, and "loudness" of a song and see if there is a trend. 

In the end, I will state that music aesthetics should be diverse and should not be bound by unified rules and regulations and ask the question "will TikTok kill the artistry of musical compositions by clicks and algorithms?" It is undeniable that TikTok is playing an increasingly pivotal role in the music industry and the cooperation between major labels, record companies and TikTok is deepening as they are communicating closely for maximizing commercial interests. 

This will target more towards younger generations, TikTok users and music lovers as well as the general public. Here is the story arc:

## Data

There are three data sets I am planning to use:

- TikTok Popular Songs 2022 from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sveta151/tiktok-popular-songs-2022?resource=download)
- Billboard Hot 100  from [Data World](https://data.world/kcmillersean/billboard-hot-100-1958-2017)
- Top Spotify Songs 2010-2019 from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leonardopena/top-spotify-songs-from-20102019-by-year)

The TikTok 2022 dataset contains


## Method and Medium

This project will be completed using Shorthand to make the web more engaging and interactive to the audience. All the data visualizations will be done using Tableau and Florish and link to Shorthand to back up the story. There will be two versions of Shorthand created: one with detail on all the stories, data visualizations, and examples and another condensed version for in-class presentation.
