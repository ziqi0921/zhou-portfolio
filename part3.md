## Project Summary

In part I, when I was asked to find a topic for final project, I wanted to find a topic that relates to my interest and where I wanted to work in the future. I choose to do a project about TikTok's influence to the music industry because it is begining to change people's way of consume music and more artists will produce songs from the trends on TikTok. Therefore, I found TikTok datasets and considered comparing them with Billboard and Spotify's datasets to see if this trend is actually shown by the data. 

In part II, I created my story wireframe and asked three intended audience for a short interview on my project. The feedbacks I got from them allows me to further develop my project. They told me to think more about my call to action and how to connect with my story better as my last version jumped from analyzing the trends to a copyright call-to-action. I created it that way because I wanted to give a more specific call-to-action instead of raising awareness to protect the creative space. Therefore, I decided to dig more into copyright issues by finding more statistics about how many videos have violated the copyright rules. It turns out that I am able to find data on the number of videos removed by the platform, and a portion of the videos goes to integrity and authenticity, which is linked to copyright infringement. From there, I decided to give two call-to-actions: one for music labels and one for TikTok users. Companies and individual artists can analyze trends to make their songs more feasible on TikTok but keep in mind of diversity, and TikTok users can protect the creative environment by following the rules of the platform on copyright and report copyright infrigements. 

Over the developing process, the scope of my project has changed

### Design Decisions and Observations

I spend a lot of time cleaning up te datasets and matching them because many of them are only the data from one year and I wanted to look at the trends over several years. 


## Audience

In part I, I said my intended audience is the general public, music labels, and TikTo users. However, I realized later that this is too broad for the intended audience. In part II, I think my intended audience are TikTok users are younger generations because they are the people that cares about TikTok. However, the in-class discussion between several peers changed my mind when they said that the focus of my project is mainly geared towards the music labels because it is more about analyzing trends. 

As I continue to refine my project, I am determined that the intended audience for this project contains music creaters and distributors (music companies, record labels, musicians, individual artists) because the first part of my project is analyzing trends for music features that are popular on the music platforms and how TikTok is a game-changer for the music industry. Another part of my intended audience is all TikTok users because in the second part of my

During my presentation, I expect my audiences to first be
